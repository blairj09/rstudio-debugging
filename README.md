# RStudio Debugging Webinar

The R language has a collection of packages, functions, and tools that can be
used to help identify and diagnose errors in R code. The [RStudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) provides easy access to many
these tools to make the process of debugging easier for the R developer. This
webinar highlights best practices for debugging R code in RStudio.

The data used in this webinar comes from
[opendata.utah.gov](https://opendata.utah.gov/Health/HCAHPS-Hospital-Ratings-For-Utah/a9vm-dqxv)
and contains hospital ratings data for hospitals in Utah.
